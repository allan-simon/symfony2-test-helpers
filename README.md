## Symfony2 functionnal test helpers

This library offer you a set of Traits to ease the creation of
functionnal tests for both REST api and normal HTML controllers of
your symfony2 application. It also take care as much as possible
to close the database connections after the tests are done (which
by default phpunit seems not to do)
